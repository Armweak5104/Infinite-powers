# Infinite-powers
The code was written in p5js and the platform I used was CodePen /n What the code does is that it provides help with different math topics such as quadratic eqns/ simultaneous eqns/ plotting graphs. /n There are other topics involved, my favorite being calculus, hence I felt it would be more meaningful to visualize the concept of differentiation and integration. Any requests/ suggestions are welcome /n the name of the pen on CodePen is called 'Sollicitat'
