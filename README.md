# Infinite-powers
The code was written in p5js and the platform I used was CodePen.
What the code does is that it provides help with different math topics such as quadratic eqns/ simultaneous eqns/ plotting graphs. 
There are other topics involved, my favorite being calculus, hence I felt it would be more meaningful to visualize the concept of differentiation and integration. 
Any requests/suggestions are welcome. 
The name of the pen on CodePen is called 'Sollicitat'. 
**If you want to run the code run it on https://codepen.io/Armweak/pen/WNMWYjm as it has some pre-downloaded libraries needed (just copy paste the code) remeber to fork your own version so you dont interfere with the public template
